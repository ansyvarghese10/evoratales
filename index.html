            <h2>About Evora Tales</h2>
            <p>Evora Tales is an independent media collective exploring the intersections of people, nature, travel, and place. We create written narratives, print editions, and documentaries that highlight culture, environmental conservation, and sustainable development.</p>
            <p>Our work aims to inspire thoughtful travel, advocate for environmental stewardship, and reveal the deep connections between culture and landscape.</p>

            <h2>Eyes of Vagabonds</h2>
            <p><em>Moments fade. Meaning stays. We capture both.</em></p>
            <p>Eyes of Vagabonds is the visual wing of Evora Tales, dedicated to capturing the quiet, layered beauty of the world through photography and film. We document moments of place, people, and movement â€” not for spectacle, but for presence.</p>
            <p>From landscapes shaped by time to everyday gestures, our lens seeks what often goes unseen. Rooted in curiosity, Eyes of Vagabonds tells visual stories that reflect ecological awareness, cultural depth, and a sense of wandering with intention.</p>
