            <h2>Eyes of Vagabonds</h2>
            <p>Moments fade. Meaning stays. We capture both.</p>
            <p>Eyes of Vagabonds is the visual wing of Evora Tales, dedicated to capturing the quiet, layered beauty of the world through photography and film. We document moments of place, people, and movement â€” not for spectacle, but for presence.</p>
            <p>From landscapes shaped by time to everyday gestures, our lens seeks what often goes unseen. Rooted in curiosity, Eyes of Vagabonds tells visual stories that reflect ecological awareness, cultural depth, and a sense of wandering with intention.</p>
